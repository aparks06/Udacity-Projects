 This suppository contains a few of the projects that I worked on while studying Business Analytics at Udacity. The projects walked through a few skill sets such as <Strong>Excel, SQL and Tableau.</strong>
  
  <h2> Project #1 </h2>
  The first project was split into 3 parts:
  
  1.  Come up with a question using the dataset and Excel, then create a presentation for your analysis (Summary Statistics)

  2.  Create a Profit Loss Statement
  
  3.  Create a Forcasting Model that is dynamic
  
  <h2> Project #2 </h2>
  The parts for this project include:
  
  1.  Create 4 questions using the data set (Digital Music Store Database)
  
  2.  Use SQL to create the data to use in a visualization for each question. (JOIN and 1 Aggregation function must be used)

  3.  Each slide has to have a brief explanation of the data.
  
  <h2> Project #3 </h3>
  The parts of this project include:
  
  1.  Using one of 3 datasets and creating a Dashboard in Tableau
  
  2.  Brief summary of the visual and any findings
